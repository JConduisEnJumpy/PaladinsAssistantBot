# Paladins Discord Helper Bot
Bot that does a lot of useful things for people who play the game Paladins.

This bot uses [PaladinsGuru](http://paladins.guru/) and Paladins API (through the wrapper [Pyrez](https://github.com/luissilva1044894/Pyrez)) to get stats for players.

1. Can create random teams for Custom Matches in Paladins.
2. Also can randomly select from any class, a champion for someone. Or a random map.
3. Can get stats for a player (overall, elo, current match, and per champion).
